  ## About the data

  This dataset shows the locations of conservation areas.

Within these areas special planning controls operate which need to be considered when undertaking development.

  Use this service to:

  - check your data follows the standard
  - get your data published

  {{ govukButton({
    text: "Start now",
    href: "/data-subject",
    isStartButton: true
  }) }}

  ## Before you check your data

  You need to prepare your:

  - conservation area data
  - listed building data
  - article 4 direction data
  - tree preservation order data

  You may need to create more than one set of data for each subject. You'll find what to include in the [data specifications](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/guidance/specifications/).

  We will accept data supplied as either:

  - CSV
  - GeoJSON
  - GML
  - GeoPackage

  {# These may be uploaded to a single URL, or served via an OGC WFS or ArcGIS API. #}

  ## Before you can publish your data

  You must be able to create or edit a webpage on your local planning authority’s (LPA) website. This will probably have a URL ending in .gov.uk or .org.

  If you’re not able to do this, you’ll need to ask the person who updates your website.

  The webpage needs to include:

  - a summary of what the data is about
  - a confirmation that the data is provided under the Open Government License
  - the date you created or updated the webpage
  - links to your data on this page, for example a CSV

  {{ govukDetails({
    summaryText: "Example webpage",
    text: example | govukMarkdown(headingsStartWith="m")
  }) }}

  This webpage URL must not change, so we can keep collecting the data. If the URL does change, send an email to [digitalland@levellingup.gov.uk](mailto:digitalland@levellingup.gov.uk).
